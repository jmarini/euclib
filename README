	This project is licensed under the LGPL, which is located in the file
	"LICENSE".

about:
	Generic 2D geometry library providing points, lines, polygons, and many
	helper functions including (when it's done) transformations, combinations,
	and intersections.
	Since the library is far from complete, expect sudden changes in interface
	and use until finalization of those aspects.
	
note on compilation:
	This project is partially an exploration of the new C++0x language features
	by myself, as well as an exploration into generic library design and thus this
	project extensively uses C++0x constructs and language features, most notably:
		rvalue references
		variadic templates
		static_assert
		intializer lists
		auto
		nullptr
	Make sure you are using at least gcc 4.6 with the -std=c++0x flag or a
	compiler that will support these features.  Additionally, I am using some
	boost dependencies so having boost installed to <boost/...> is required.

usage:
	Since this is a generic library, it will most likely need only header file
	includes to integrate properly.  The header file "euclib.hpp" includes all
	of the other files needed, or you can include them individually as needed.
